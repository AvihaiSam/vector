## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Removal metadata functions {#metadata=functions-removal}

Vector `0.25.0` introduced new metadata path syntax available in VRL which points
directly to event metadata. That meant the metadata functions were no longer necessary and
were deprecated. They are now being removed. The table below shows you how to convert
VRL code from the method calls to the new path syntax. If you are running Vector `0.25.0`
or later, you will also receive warnings which will provide you with the correct
syntax to use to migrate.

|--------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|
| get    | get_metadata_field(.foo.bar)          | %foo.bar           |
| set    | set_metadata_field(.foo.bar, "value") | %foo.bar = "value" |
| delete | remove_metadata_field(.foo.bar)       | del(%foo.bar)      |
